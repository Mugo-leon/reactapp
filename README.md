# Welcome to IMMUNIZER SCHEDULER

The Immunizer Schedule app is designed to assist users in tracking and managing their child's immunization schedule. This application allows users to submit their child's age and provides detailed information about past and future immunizations, including what immunizations the child should have already received and when, as well as what immunizations are due next and when they should be administered.
